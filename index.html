                    <p class="firstparagraphindent"> Proven leader with 15+ years of telecom experience developing and rolling out robust strategies that drive margin growth and business unit proÔ¨Åtability.  Passion for process improvement achieved through cross functional technical training because our organizations are only as strong as their weakest link.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p> Achieving maximum efficiency via automation, and continuously dedicated towards elimination of  repetitive tasks carried out by manual resources.  I think we can all agree that our time is too precious to be spent merging data from various department when there is already so little time available to us for creating special moments doing whatever it is that we love, creating the moments that take our breath away.</p> 
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Dedication to quality control and customer service that borderlines on the obsessive has served to ensure a steady growth of business partners while maintaining those anchoring relationships which have been there since the beginning. </p>
